         <p> The Green Space is a place where fashion meets sustainability. The Green Space gives GSU students the ability to engage in eco-friendly practices while adding trendy and personalized items to their closets. </p>
         <h2>Our Story</h2>
         <p> Motivated to conduct meaningful change, our team created the Green Space to address clothing waste in a creative and exciting way. Our mission is to address and help combat the  environmental impact of fast fashion by promoting a culture of reuse, swapping, and sustainability within the GSU community. With this website, we hope to do just that. </p>
